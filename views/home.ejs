<!-- 
 This page is acting as a dashboard that can move on to 
 other pages like viewing the products or producing a form to 
 fill out when adding a new one. It is useful to use ejs as it is a good templating engine 
 for node and does notable things like server-side rendering and is tightly integrated within
 express. It also uses css styles from the CSS stylesheet created in the project. The main focus is 
 that it links to other imortant ejs files that do other important tasks.

    <h3>Broken Stuff (that I may one day fix)</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <!-- Notes that the GUI form edit functionality is broken -->
        <li>Edit products doesn't work using the gui form, however, it does work using API PUT method</li>

        <!-- Suggests need for backend validation logic -->
        <li><em>Not broken, but </em>logic is needed to handle strings, floats, and ints for form inputs. Currently, there is
            validation on the form (frontend), but doesn't have a backend check. Ideally, we would have both.</li>

        <!-- Suggests some improvements for sorting -->
        <li><em>Not broken, but </em>The product list doesn't perform any sort when pulled. Should implement multiple sorts and a dropdown to select which one.</li>
    </ul>
